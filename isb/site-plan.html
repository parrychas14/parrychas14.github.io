      <p>
        For anyone concerned about their safety, please look here. We take the safety of everyone seriously and have our own items and suggestions for anyone that needs it. All the security threats we are prepared to deal with are burglars, aliens, zombies, ghosts, and robots. Items come in all different shapes and sizes, as well as what they are most effective against.

      <h3>Burglars</h3>
      <p>
        Burglars are common threats to any household. They could come at any time, and seize your belongings, in order to make some money themselves. Commonly the best way to take care of a burglar is with locks for every possible entry, as well as electronics such as alarms that can be placed all around the building, and security cameras, that should help when dealing with police on the matter. Overall, this is probably the least serious threat you could face out of any that we know of.

      <h3>Zombies</h3>
      <p>
        You may think this is ridiculous, but we assure you it is something to worry about, and there is no such thing as a friendly zombie. There is no case where a zombie hasnâ€™t tried to enter a house, so it is extremely important to take the necessary precautions. Zombies were the result of a virus accidentally created by scientists, and a bite will make a person another zombie in just a about an hour. There are many different recommended defenses against zombies. We would recommend steel doors and boarded up windows to start. We would also say that rotating remote control turrets would also do the job.
